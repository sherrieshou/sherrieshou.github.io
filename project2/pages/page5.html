    We have all had the <button onclick="show_hide3()">experience</button>, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the <button onclick="show_hide()">temple's treasures</button>, hanging in a large, deeply recessed <button onclick="show_hide2()">alcove. </button>
    </div>
<div id="hide">
    Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony.
</div>
<div id="hide2">

</div>
<div id="hide3">
