<div class="text1">
    How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. 
</div>

<div class="text2">
    Statues<br/>
    of the Buddha<br/>
    were gilt with gold

<div class="text4">
    Modem man, in his well-lit house,<br/>
    knows nothing of the beauty of gold; 
</div>

<div class="text5">
    Who lived in the dark houses<br/>
    of the past were not merely<br/>
    captivated by its beauty, they<br/>
    also knew its practical value; 
</div>

<div class="text6">
    For gold, in these dim rooms,<br/>
    must have served the function of a reflector. 
</div>

<div class="text7">
    Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. 
</div>

<div class="text8">
    Its reflective properties were put to use as a source of illumination. 
</div>


<div class="text9">
    Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss,<br/>
    but gold retains its brilliance<br/>
    indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. 
</div>


<div class="text10">
    This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.
